### [Front end](https://www.merch-dropper.com/) built using:

#### ReactJS

We chose this framework because:

- Most familiarity with React as a FE framework
- Single Page Application
- It is very responsive


#### axios
#### enzyme
#### bootstrap
#### reactstrap
#### styled-components
#### redux 
#### redux-persist
#### redux-logger
#### redux-thunk
#### cloudinary
#### react-stripe-checkout
#### react-stripe-elements


#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/Merch-Dropper-be) built using:

#### NodeJS

- Having a true relational database will work very well with the data we expect to be using.
- Everyone on the team has a working knowledge of NodeJS and that'll make it easier to debug if we ever run into any issues.

#### knex

#### knex-cleaner

#### postgreSQL

#### express

# APIs

<!-- auth0 -->
## Auth0 <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Cib-auth0_%28CoreUI_Icons_v1.0.0%29.svg" width="50">

Auth0 authentication API allows users to manage all aspects if user identity. It offeres endpoints so your users can log in, sign up, log out , access other API's, and more. The API is designed for people comfortable with integrating RESTful API's.

<!-- Stripe  -->
## Stripe <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Stripe_Logo%2C_revised_2016.svg" width="50">

Stripe is a service that allows merchants to accept payments online especially developers. The Stripe API alloes developers to access fucntionality of Stripe. The API is organized around REST; it has predictable resource-oriented URL's, accepts form-encoded requesdt bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs. The Stripe API has test mode available for ease of development and does not affect live data or interact with any banking networks.

## Cloudinary <img src="https://d7umqicpi7263.cloudfront.net/img/product/e0cd61a7-1c65-45a0-97ee-7763ddc5153a/25b21b50-a15d-44b2-a781-b68b9de3d17b.png" width="120">

Cloudinary is an end-to-end image- and video-management solution for websites and mobile apps, covering everything from image and video uploads, storage, manipulations, optimizations to delivery. The Cloudinary API utilizes REST API methods that can be called directly from within your client application or by using one of Cloudinary's SDKs that wrap the REST API and greatly simplify using its methods. Authenticated uploading is done over HTTPS using a secure protocol based on your account's cloud_name, api_key and api_secret parameters.

## Scalable Press <img src="https://scalablepress.com/images/scalablepress_logo.png" width="50">

The Scalable Press API is a comprehensive REST service for viewing the product catalog, making quotes, and completing orders for the Scalable Press printing and fulfillment services. Requests are made using standard GET, POST, and DELETE requests. All responses are JSON. Once signed up, an API key and a test API key will be provided to the customer to use in their client App. When using the test API key, it works just like the Stripe test API key where no charges are made against the user.
